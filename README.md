# Text Generator App

## What is that?

You can generate random paragraphs with as many as you want. You have two options, html or text. If you select the html the paragraphs will be displayed as html.
To generate random paragraphs, I used https://baconipsum.com/api/?type=all-meat&paras=2&format=text.
